# Indicators

## Overview

The toolbox provides a repository of predefined indicators and simple tools to add new, custom indicators.

### Structure

By default, the central unit of observation is the forum **thread**, which can be part of one or multiple sub-forums. We propose that a thread is the *observable trace* of a sequence of interactions that can represent or display innovation activities. Each post in a thread is a **contribution** by a community member (the **contributor**). We single out the **initial contribution**, as we assume that XYZ. A **community** consists of a number of contributors and their contributions in threads, which are organized in sub-forums.

### Networks

Additional levels of observation are the **networks** formed by contributors. The two main representations are the *co-contribution network* and the *comment network*.

`co-contributor network`

: The co-contributor network is an *undirected graph* where each node represents a contributor. A pair of contributors is connected by an edge if both have contributed in at least one shared thread. The edge weight is proportional to the number of threads both contributed to.

`commenter network`

: The commenter network is a *directed graph* where each node represents a contributor. A contributor *A* has an edge pointing to contributor *B* if *A* has contributed in at least one thread where contributor *B* has posted the initial contribution (*A* has "commented"). The weight of edge *A*→*B* is proportional to the total number of comments *A* made on initial contributions of *B*.

### Levels of observation

Each indicator is observed on either **contributor**, **contribution**, **thread**, or **community** level. Aggregations of indicators are provided for higher levels. For example, the *number of contributions made by a contributor* can be an indicator for their role in the community. This indicator would be provided on thread-level as, e.g., *average number of contributions per contributor*, measured for all contributors that have contributed to a specific thread. Common aggregations are mean, sum, standard-deviation, min and max. Other aggregations (or *transformations*) could also pick out a single of multiple values. On thread-level, an example would be the *total number of contributions made by the contributor of the initial contribution*.

The thread observation level can be subdivided into three further subsets of posts: the whole thread, only the **initial contribution**, or only the **feedback** (all posts that were not authored by the initial contributor). This helps to implement indicators that rely on more detailed concepts, such as *ideas* in *idea communities*, or *questions* in *question communities*, which can potentially be operationalized by *inital contribution*.

### Data

In order to be able to apply indicators to a heterogeneous set of communities, most indicators rely on the following basic data that can be collected from most online forums:

- contribution meta data: contributor, date, associated thread, position in thread, sub-forum
- contribution content: text, html, extracted links, images
- contributor properties: name/id
- thread: title

Other data, such as likes/upvotes, friendship-relations, contributor location, thread views, etc., might be available in some communities and can be included in more specialized indicators.

### List of indicators

The following list conceptually groups all available indicators. Each indicator description links to all relevant metrics that are implemented in the toolbox. Each indicator is labelled with its level of observation: <span class="label contributor">contributor</span> <span class="label contribution">contribution</span> <span class="label initial-contribution">initial contribution</span>
 <span class="label thread">thread</span> <span class="label community">community</span>. Specialized indicators are marked with <span class="label specialized">specialized</span> and state which additional data is required.

Please refer to the [user guide]() and the [examples]() on how to [generate the indicators]() or how to [implement a custom indicator]().

The diversity of a contributor's contributions in regard to which sub-forum they were made to. Diversity is either defined as a) *total number of different sub-forums*, or b) *the entropy of contributing behavior in gerade to sub-forum "classes"*. Each metric is defined for both 1) *all contributions*, and 2) *inital contributions* only.

#### Concept

Contributors can be classified by how much they engage in discussions by commenting (reacting to initial contributions), versus how much they initially contribute themselves. [1] distinguish the four classes "collaborator", "contributor", "allrounder", and "passive user". For example, "collaborators" are contributors that are often involved in discussions, but do not often contribute own ideas. Their contributions were found to be of higher quality in a crowdsourcing context [1].

[1] constructed a social network of "actor-to-actor relationships" "based on comments written on ideas". They used in-degree (comments received) and out-degree (comments given), as well as the number of contributions (ideas, stories, etc.) to determine user clusters (k-means) and users' roles. Qualitatively, their classification/clustering results can be summarized as:

|              | In-degree | Out-degree | Contributions |
|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Collaborator | High      | High       | Low           |
| Contributor  | High      | High       | High          |
| Allrounder   | Medium    | Medium     | Medium        |
| Passive user | Low       | Low        | Low           |

#### Metrics

This group of metrics assigns one of the four classes to each contributor: It uses the co-contribution network to determine each user's number of "received" and "given" comments (weighted in- and out-degree). In- and out-degree and number of initial posts form the basis for a community-level clustering with a fixed number of four clusters. Cluster centers are then ranked, and cluster labels assigned according to the table above.

### Fueller-role

<span class="label contributor">contributor</span>

#### Concept

In the context of innovation-contest communities, [1] define six contributor roles by qualitative evaluation of contributor clusters, formed based on contribution patterns. Contribution patterns are defined on a co-contribution network using in-degree (comments directed towards contributor), out-degree (comments made by contributor), and number of contributions by contributor. The roles are labelled *socializer*, *idea generator*, *master*, *efficient contributor*, *passive idea generator*, and *passive commentator* (see table below). They find that  

|                        | In-degree | Out-degree | Contributions |
|------------------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Socializer             | Low       | High       | Low           |
| Idea generator         | Medium    | Low        | High          |
| Master                 | Very high | High       | Very high     |
| Efficient contributor  | Medium    | Low        | Medium        |
| Passive idea generator | None      | None       | Very low      |
| Passive commentator    | None      | Very low   | None          |
